# Building an interpreter


The project contains code that is a rsult of reading the book - "Build an Interpreter in Go - Thorsten Ball"

Thorsten chose Golang to create the interpreter also known as the "host language" for this programming language called - "Monkey"

I chose javascript, just because that is what I have been using at the time of writing this.

If you want to try out the language, check the REPL: `npm run repl`
